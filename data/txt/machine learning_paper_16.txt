Abstract:
With the rapid development of big data technologies, how to dig out useful
information from massive data becomes an essential problem. However, using
machine learning algorithms to analyze large data may be time-consuming and
inefficient on the traditional single machine. To solve these problems, this
paper has made some research on the parallelization of several classic machine
learning algorithms respectively on the single machine and the big data
platform Spark. We compare the runtime and efficiency of traditional machine
learning algorithms with parallelized machine learning algorithms respectively
on the single machine and Spark platform. The research results have shown
significant improvement in runtime and efficiency of parallelized machine
learning algorithms.
