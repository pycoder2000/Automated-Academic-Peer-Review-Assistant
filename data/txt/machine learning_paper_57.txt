Abstract:
The application of machine learning to radiological images is an increasingly
active research area that is expected to grow in the next five to ten years.
Recent advances in machine learning have the potential to recognize and
classify complex patterns from different radiological imaging modalities such
as x-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron
emission tomography imaging. In many applications, machine learning based
systems have shown comparable performance to human decision-making. The
applications of machine learning are the key ingredients of future clinical
decision making and monitoring systems. This review covers the fundamental
concepts behind various machine learning techniques and their applications in
several radiological imaging areas, such as medical image segmentation, brain
function studies and neurological disease diagnosis, as well as computer-aided
systems, image registration, and content-based image retrieval systems.
Synchronistically, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future
directions regarding the application of machine learning in radiological
imaging. By giving insight on how take advantage of machine learning powered
applications, we expect that clinicians can prevent and diagnose diseases more
accurately and efficiently.
