Abstract:
Transparent machine learning is introduced as an alternative form of machine
learning, where both the model and the learning system are represented in
source code form. The goal of this project is to enable direct human
understanding of machine learning models, giving us the ability to learn,
verify, and refine them as programs. If solved, this technology could represent
a best-case scenario for the safety and security of AI systems going forward.
